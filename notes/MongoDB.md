## MongoDB
MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.

## mongoose.js
Interact with mongoose database

We'll be building out each feature in our application in three phases:
Create the mongoose Models
Create any helper methods on our models and route middleware required for the feature
Creating the route to expose the functionality to our users

### Define your schema
Everything in Mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.
